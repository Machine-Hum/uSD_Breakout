Introduction
------------
kicad StepUp is a 3D mechanical exporter for kicad board and assemblies +
It will improve a collaborative exchange between KiCad and FreeCAD/MCAD +
With *kicad StepUp* script, it is possible to work in kicad EDA with the same component model data
available in the *STEP AP214 3D format*, and obtain a 3D STEP AP214 model of the pcb board and
a complete board assemblies with electronic modules, to be used for *MCAD interchange*. +
The accurate 3D visualization of components on board assemblies in kicad 3dviewer, can then be
maintained in the same accuracy and aspect in STEP AP214 format, just generating VRML models
from STEP or FreeCAD mechanical models and exporting the board through kicad StepUp script. +
The *kicad StepUp* script maintains the usual way to work with kicad, but improves the process
to work in a collaborative way with mechanical designers bringing near ECAD and MCAD environments. +

Kicad StepUp allows the user to modeling the 3D modules starting from FreeCAD
(instead of using Wings3D), creating models in STEP AP214 and rendering the
pcb board and components in native STEP AP214. +
*Note:* *kicad StepUp* 3D MCAD exporter is compatible with: +
      *STEP* with colors files (_.step_, _.stp_ extensions) +
      *IGES* with colors files (_.iges_, _.igs_ extensions) +

Designing in kicad native 3d-viewer will produce a fully aligned STEP version
with the same view of kicad 3d render. +
Now the two words have the same accurate 3D visualization; it is possible to design in kicad EDA and transfer the artwork to MCAD (FreeCAD) smoothly

Basic How To '(using kicad StepUp the easiest way)'
---------------------------------------------------

*(not changing the way you use kicad)*

*1.* just copy the STEP 3d models in the same folder in which there are your wrl 3d models and
   use the same name of the wrl model name (e.g. r_0603.wrl => r_0603.step) +
*2.* open in FreeCAD the Macro kicad-StepUp-tools.FCMacro and
   edit the config file ksu-config.ini (wich is autogenerate at first running of the macro) with e.g. notepad changing your model prefix to your KISYS3DMOD path +
*3.* clik on the button to open your kicad pcbnew board file +
*4.* watch the script assembling your 3D board with 3D models :) +
you can also add the macro button to the FreeCAD toolbar following these instructions: +
 *Note:* link:http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Customize_ToolsBar[FreeCAD forum Customize Toolbar] how to add a button to Toolbar in FreeCAD
 adding also the kicad StepUp icon +
*5.* the Macro can be executed as a script
    <path to Freecad executable file>/freecad <path to the Macro file>/kicad-StepUp-tools.FCMacro <name_of_board_without_extension> +
    '(e.g. freecad kicad-StepUp-tools.FCMacro myboard)' +
*just watch the Macro assembling your 3D board with 3D models :)* +
*6.* the kicad StepUp can be also a Mod WorkBench for FreeCAD: +
copy the folder kicadStepUpMod in the right folder for your OS +
link:http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Installing_more_workbenches[FreeCAD Installing workbenches]

How To '(using kicad StepUp the best way)'
------------------------------------------

*(getting the best from STEP models)*

*1.* just copy the STEP 3d models in the same folder in which there are your wrl 3d models +
*2.* export the STEP models, scaled 1/2.54 to wrl with the same name of the STEP model
(e.g. r_0603.wrl => r_0603.step); in this way your 3D board in kicad pcbnew 3d-viewer and in FreeCAD workbench will look perfectly aligned +
*3.* open in FreeCAD the Macro kicad-StepUp-tools.FCMacro and
   edit the config file ksu-config.ini (wich is autogenerate at first running of the macro) with e.g. notepad changing your model prefix to your KISYS3DMOD path +
*4.* clik on the button to open your kicad pcbnew board file +
*5.* watch the script assembling your 3D board with 3D models :) +
you can also add the macro button to the FreeCAD toolbar following these instructions: +
 *Note:* link:http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Customize_ToolsBar[FreeCAD forum Customize Toolbar] how to add a button to Toolbar in FreeCAD
 adding also the kicad StepUp icon +
*6.* the Macro can be executed as a script
    <path to Freecad executable file>/freecad <path to the Macro file>/kicad-StepUp-tools.FCMacro <name_of_board_without_extension> +
    '(e.g. freecad kicad-StepUp-tools.FCMacro myboard)' +
*just watch the Macro assembling your 3D board with 3D models :)*
*7.* the kicad StepUp can be also a Mod WorkBench for FreeCAD: +

.kicad StepUp WorkFlow
image::images/ksu-workflow.png[]


Create your own Library
----------------------

The way to build a STEP models library to be easily used by the script is:

1. *Load the kicad footprint* inside FreeCAD using kicad StepUp tools
2. use the footprint as a reference for your model position
3. start modeling your 3d object in scale 1:1 in mm
(which is the way in which mechanical stuff are used to be) +
4. export STEP and VRML of your model just clicking on the "Export STEP & VRML" button +
5. assure that your STEP module *is fused to just one solid object* +
(_Part Boolean Union in FreeCAD_ or _Part Makecompound in FreeCAD_) +
*Note:* here link:http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=8451#p69489[FreeCAD forum fusion howto] some tips to fuse correctly objects in FreeCAD +
6. use the same name to wrl and STEP model +
7. put the STEP model and VRML model in the same place +
8. check if your vrml model is aligned to the kicad pcb footprint in pcbnew 3d-viewer +
*all the conversion steps* can be done with the use of *'kicad-SteUp-tools.FCMacro'* +
It is possible to *Load the kicad footprint* inside FreeCAD to _interactively align 3d model
to the footprint_ in a live visual feedback +
*Note:* *kicad StepUp* 3D MCAD exporter is compatible with: +
      *STEP* with colors files (_.step_, _.stp_ extensions) +
      *IGES* with colors files (_.iges_, _.igs_ extensions) +

Using kicad pre-built libraries: +
some ready-to-go 3D libraries are ready at +

<<< 

Interactively align 3D part to kicad footprint
----------------------------------------------
With *'kicad-SteUp-tools Macro'* it is possible to *Load the kicad footprint* in FreeCAD +
and align the 3D part with a visual real time feedback of the 3d model and footprint reciprocal position. +
Once the 3D part is aligned to the footprint pads and silk, the model can be exported
in STEP format and in VRML format for kicad 3d-rendering, just clicking on the *Export STEP & VRML* button. +
*That will align EDA to MCAD 3d viewers*. No need to reiterate the aligning process or empiric calculate
offset and rotation to apply to VRML model. +
You can also click on *'Create axis'* button to have an other help in the part orienting process +

TIP: Tip. +
footprint aligner workflow: +
- load the Macro +
- open the 3d STEP model in FC +
- Load the footprint with the macro Button +
 +
or +
 +
- Load the footprint with the macro Button +
- import the 3d model in FC +
  (*NB Import Ctrl+I*, 'not Open Ctrl+O')


TIP: Tip. +
use the *'kicad-SteUp-tools.FCMacro'* to easily align the 3D model to the footprint
(then it will be aligned to the footprint also in kicad) +
(previously known as **'move-rotate-scale macro'**) +
the macro can be launched with: +
 +./launch-kicad_StepUp-Tools.sh+ +
 or with +
 +launch-kicad_StepUp-Tools.bat+ +
 or just open the macro in FreeCAD and run it +
 or add the macro button to the FreeCAD toolbar following these instructions: +
 *Note:* link:http://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/index.php?title=Customize_ToolsBar[FreeCAD forum Customize Toolbar] how to add a button to Toolbar in FreeCAD
 adding also the kicad StepUp icon +

<<<

*Note:* +
the macro takes care of 2D footprint rotation of kicad for the footprint alignment +
it does take care of vrml model 'z' rotation, it doesn't take care of 'x' and 'y' 3d model rotation +
it doesn't take care of 'x', 'y', 'z' 3d model translation +

this behaviour is intentional... you have to align your 3d STEP model of Freecad to your 2D footprint of kicad, +
then if you export your step model to vrml (scaling 1/2.54) the vrml model will be aligned too +

one has to check/modify, if needed, the part of 3D vrml model in kicad as following +

`(model path/name.wrl` +
`(at (xyz 0 0 0))` +
`(scale (xyz 1 1 1))` +
`(rotate (xyz 0 0 0))` +

`at (xyz 0 0 0)` is mandatory, as much as `scale (1 1 1)` +
`rotate (xyz 0 0 z_value)` can have a z rotation value +
(those fields can be changed on the .kicad_mod text file or through the kicad GUI) +
 +
*rotation values and position translations are taken in care ONLY by the StepUp assembler 
when loading a board and models*

Generating smaller 3D model with bounding boxes
------------------------------------------------

Sometimes the need would be just a 3D MCAD model for analysis or simple space constraints,
so a nice detailed component models in MCAD system may be not required or desired; +
in that case it is possible to configure the exporter to: +

- skip 3D models by name +
- skip models with a volume less than an assigned value +
- skip models with a height less than an assigned value +
- convert the remaining parts, or all but edge connectors, to bounding boxes +

The result 3D MCAD model will have the accuracy of the pcb and assemblies only when needed,
maintaining the model light as required. +

The config file  _ksu-config.cfg_ let you configure the following parameters:

1. 3D path prefix +
   your KISYS3DMOD path (see kicad for help) or 3D model path prefix +
   ${KIPRJMOD}, ${KIPRJMOD}, :ALIAS:, ${ENV} vars are supported
2. blacklist of 3D models +
   none=all 3D models will be parsed; +
   volume=1 means all models with a volume < 1mm3 will not be included +
   height=1 means all models with a height < 1mm  will not be included
3. pcb color r,g,b +
   e.g. 0.0,0.5,0.0,light green
4. bounding box option +
   LIST list of modules, separated by a comma, not converted to bbox +
   ALL or off
5. placement options of board and parts +
   useAuxOrigin, useBaseOrigin, useBasePoint;x;y, usedefault, +AutoAdjust
6. virtual modules to be or not added to board +
   if a module has vitual attribute in kicad pcbnew, can be selectively parsed
7. fuse modules to board and make a single object of pcb and parts +
   fuseAll, nofuse +
   Note: be careful ... fusion can be heavy or generate FC crash with a lot of objects +
   please consider to use bbox or blacklist small objs in case of 'fuseAll' option
8. allow compound for STEP models +
   allow compound if you want to allow multi-part STEP models
9. turntable spin after loading +
   enable or disable spinning after loading the board
10. font size for ksu widget

Check for Collisions and mechanical constrains
----------------------------------------------
With *'kicad-SteUp-tools Macro'* it is also possible to *detect collisions* +
and *check mechanical constrains* +
- detect collisions among part pins and drills +
- detect collisions for enclosure clearance +
  (between pcb with connectors and enclosure) +

Create boxes or cylinders using dimensions as in scale values of wrl model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------


This feature will be triggered only if the wrl models have the following names: + 

** box_mcad.wrl
** cylV_mcad.wrl
** cylH_mcad.wrl

When kicad StepUp tools will parse these special names, correspondent models will be generated in FreeCAD using the dimensions as per the scale values indicated in the kicad_pcb file.
the *3 special wrl models are in the "shapes" folder of the demo project* +

So it is possible to use simple generic shapes to generate bounding box like ECAD and MCAD models...
